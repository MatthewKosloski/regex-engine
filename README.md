# regex-engine

A (work-in-progress) DFA-driven regular expression engine. As a starting point, the engine's parser will support all regular expressions that can be generated using this grammar:

```
regex -> expr* ;
expr -> kleene_expr alt_expr ;
alt_expr -> "|" kleene_expr alt_expr | Îµ ;
kleene_expr -> paren_expr "*"? ;
paren_expr -> "(" expr+ ")" | char_expr ;
char_expr -> [a-z] | [A-Z] | [0-9] | _ ;
```

## Executing

To execute `program.ts` without compiling to JavaScript, from a terminal window, type `npm start` or select "tsx" from VSCode's debug panel.

## Debugging

To debug `program.ts`, from a terminal window, type `npm run debug` and then select "Debug" from VSCode's debug panel.
